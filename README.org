* Just a little repo to hold my code while going through:

[[https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/software-design-flexibility][Software Design For Flexibility]]

I used mit-scheme with Geiser in emacs.

Don't expect any order or working code here, I just don't want to lose work as I
dip in and out of the book every few weeks.
